Hello,

I have attached the data model from which all the business
queries can be answered. 

However, while creating the tables,I encountered some trouble 
handling the data from 'receipts.json'. The issue being that 
some values in the column having details of the number of items 
purchased have discripencies with the details for the same in
another column containing details of the reward receipt items.
Another issue I faced while handling this data is that it had 
a lot of missing values in different parts of the file.

Please provide me information regarding handling of the missing
values, at present, I have transferred all these to a different 
file.

Before going into production, the data quality in the 'receipts.json'
needs to be checked for discripencies. 

The rest of the data looks great and is ready to be pushed into production.

Thanks,
Srivathsav Mitnala
